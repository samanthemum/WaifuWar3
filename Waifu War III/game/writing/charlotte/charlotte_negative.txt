Gross! Why would I do that?
That doesn't sound that fun. Can't you make better plans?
Why are you yelling? Can you calm down? For me?
To put this lightly, I don't think you're my type. Need I say more?
Come back when you feel like having an actual talk.
I think I'm going to start crying if you keep on like that.
