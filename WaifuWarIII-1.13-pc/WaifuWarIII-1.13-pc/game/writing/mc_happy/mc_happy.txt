Good morning! It's a beautiful day.
I just wanted to check in on you.
The weather today is just grand.
Want to go for a stroll together?
Your smile is as bright as radioactive waste.
Want to just sit and watch the clouds?
My day just got brighter with you in it.
Shall we cuddle?
I was lost in the wastes. Now I'm just lost in your eyes.
Long time, no see!
