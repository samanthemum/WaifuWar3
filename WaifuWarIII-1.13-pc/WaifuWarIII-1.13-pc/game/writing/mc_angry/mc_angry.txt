*glares*
Normally I hate people. You're an exception.
I would say good morning, but I'd be lying.
Wanna start a fight?
Wanna fight me?
Let's start a riot!
Wanna fight god?
Wanna see what's under this mask?
Let's start a war!
You almost make life worth living in this hellscape.
I look pretty good on my own, but I'd look better with you.
